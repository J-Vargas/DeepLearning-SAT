# Deep Learning for SAT-4 and SAT-6 Airborne Datasets

 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning network widely used for different kind of image classification and feature extraction. The focus of our work is the use of CNN on Satellite Image classification using two datasets SAT-4 and SAT-6. 
 Satellite Image classification plays and important role when trying to analyze the earthâ€™s changes derived from climate change and other natural phenomena.
